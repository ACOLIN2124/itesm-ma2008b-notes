    "# **Brownian Motion: A Comprehensive Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Introduction to Brownian Motion**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Brownian motion**, also known as a **Wiener process**, is a fundamental stochastic process that plays a critical role in various fields such as physics, finance, and mathematics. It models the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid, originally observed by botanist **Robert Brown** in 1827. In the context of stochastic calculus, Brownian motion provides the foundation for modeling continuous-time random processes.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **2. Definition of Brownian Motion**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **standard Brownian motion** $W_t$ is a stochastic process that satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Value:**\n",
    "   ```math\n",
    "   W_0 = 0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The process starts at zero at time $t = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independent Increments:**\n",
    "   For $0 \\leq s < t$, the increment $W_t - W_s$ is independent of the process history before time $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stationary Increments:**\n",
    "   The increments are normally distributed with mean zero and variance proportional to the time increment:\n",
    "   ```math\n",
    "   W_t - W_s \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t - s)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Continuity of Paths:**\n",
    "   The function $t \\mapsto W_t$ is continuous with probability one, although the paths are nowhere differentiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Gaussian Increments:**\n",
    "   The increments are normally distributed:\n",
    "   ```math\n",
    "   W_t - W_s \\sim N(0, t - s)\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "- **Expectation and Variance:**\n",
    "  ```math\n",
    "  \\mathbb{E}[W_t] = 0, \\quad \\text{Var}(W_t) = t\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  The expected value of the process is zero, and the variance increases linearly with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Covariance Structure:**\n",
    "  ```math\n",
    "  \\text{Cov}(W_s, W_t) = \\min(s, t)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  The covariance between two time points is equal to the smaller of the two times.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Markov Property:**\n",
    "  Brownian motion has the Markov property, meaning that the future evolution of the process depends only on its current value, not on the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Martingale Property:**\n",
    "  Brownian motion is a martingale, meaning:\n",
    "  ```math\n",
    "  \\mathbb{E}[W_t \\mid \\mathcal{F}_s] = W_s \\quad \\text{for} \\quad s < t\n",

    "\n",
    "Brownian motion is a cornerstone concept in stochastic processes, characterized by its continuous, yet highly irregular paths. It models the evolution of systems influenced by randomness and is fundamental to fields ranging from financial mathematics to physics. Its properties, such as independent increments, normal distribution, and the Markov and martingale characteristics, make it an essential building block in stochastic calculus and modern probability theory."
