    "# **Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Introduction**\n",
    "The **Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)** is one of the earliest and most widely used methods for generating **pseudo-random numbers**. It is a type of **recursive formula** that produces a sequence of numbers that appear random but are **deterministic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An LCG is defined by the recurrence relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "X_{n+1} = (a X_n + c) \\mod m\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( X_n \\) is the sequence of pseudo-random numbers,\n",
    "- \\( a \\) is the **multiplier** (\\( a > 0 \\)),\n",
    "- \\( c \\) is the **increment** (\\( c \\geq 0 \\)),\n",
    "- \\( m \\) is the **modulus** (\\( m > 0 \\)),\n",
    "- \\( X_0 \\) is the **seed** (initial value).\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence \\( X_n \\) generates integers in the range \\( 0 \\leq X_n < m \\). The pseudo-random numbers are obtained by normalizing:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "U_n = \\frac{X_n}{m}, \\quad 0 \\leq U_n < 1\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( U_n \\) approximates a **uniform distribution** on \\( [0,1) \\).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Characteristics of LCG**\n",
    "### **2.1. Periodicity**\n",
    "Since the sequence is **deterministic** and operates modulo \\( m \\), it is guaranteed to **repeat** after at most \\( m \\) iterations. The **maximum possible period** is \\( m \\), which occurs when the generator satisfies the following conditions (from Hull-Dobell theorem):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \\( c \\) is **relatively prime** to \\( m \\) (i.e., \\( \\gcd(c, m) = 1 \\)),\n",
    "2. \\( a-1 \\) is a multiple of every **prime divisor** of \\( m \\),\n",
    "3. \\( a-1 \\) is a multiple of **4** if \\( m \\) is a multiple of \\( 4 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "When \\( c = 0 \\), the generator is called a **Multiplicative Congruential Generator (MCG)**, but it has a smaller period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2. Choice of Parameters**\n",
    "- **Good choices** of \\( a, c, m \\) ensure a **long period** and **good randomness properties**.\n",
    "- **Common parameters** used in practice:\n",
    "  - **RANDU (old IBM LCG)**\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    a = 65539, \\quad c = 0, \\quad m = 2^{31}\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "    (bad randomness properties)\n",
    "  - **Minimal standard LCG (Park & Miller, 1988)**\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    a = 16807, \\quad c = 0, \\quad m = 2^{31} - 1\n",
    "    \\]\n",

    "### **4.1. Advantages**\n",
    "✅ **Simple and Efficient**: Requires only multiplication, addition, and modulus operations.  \n",

    "❌ **Poor High-Dimensional Randomness**: Successive values often fall into **hyperplanes** in higher dimensions (Marsaglia’s lattice test).  \n",
    "❌ **Not Cryptographically Secure**: Since LCG is **predictable**, it should **not be used for security applications**.\n",
