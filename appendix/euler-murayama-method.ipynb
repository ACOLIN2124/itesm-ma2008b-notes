    "### **Euler–Maruyama Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Euler–Maruyama method** is a numerical technique used to approximate solutions to **stochastic differential equations (SDEs)**. It is an extension of the **Euler method** used for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), modified to handle the stochastic (random) part of SDEs, typically involving **Brownian motion**.\n",

    "dX_t = a(X_t, t) \\, dt + b(X_t, t) \\, dW_t\n",
    "$$\n",
